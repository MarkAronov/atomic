/**
 * Terminal settlement of the workflow pending-stage delivery contract.
 *
 * `stage-runner-controller` awaits `pendingStageDelivery.ready()` with no
 * timeout, and only a successful drain ever resolved it. When the Intercom
 * wrapper exhausts its bounded warm-up retries there is no owner left, so the
 * delivery needs a terminal signal: `fail(reason)` settles `ready()` exactly
 * once with a typed, stage-scoped error instead of leaving the stage parked.
 *
 * The queued entries themselves are never consumed by a stage that was already
 * failed closed — a delivery asked to drain after the latch is a silent no-op,
 * so the steering stays queued rather than being marked delivered to a stage
 * that will not read it.
 *
 * The terminal error must also not read as a *model* failure. Intercom's reason
 * nests the transport error that lost the broker, so chaining it as `cause` let
 * the shared classifier's cause walk latch `code: "ECONNRESET"` and call a dead
 * delivery a retryable `network_timeout`.
