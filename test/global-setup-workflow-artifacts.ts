/**
 * One workflow-artifact directory per vitest run, owned by the orchestrator.
 *
 * `test/setup-workflow-durability.ts` needs `ENV_WORKFLOW_ARTIFACT_DIR` set in
 * every worker so real builtin workflows cannot write run directories into the
 * developer's home. Creating the directory in the workers themselves cannot be
 * leak-free: under the default isolated forks pool each test file gets a fresh
 * process, and tinypool tears workers down with SIGTERM followed by SIGKILL
 * after 500 ms, so any worker that loses that race leaks its directory. That
 * is how 330k `atomic-test-workflow-artifacts-*` directories accumulated in
 * the OS temp dir, which made every `mkdtemp` under `tmpdir()` machine-wide
 * take seconds.
 *
 * This global setup runs once in the orchestrator, which forks every worker,
 * so workers inherit the variable and create nothing. The teardown runs after
 * the pool is gone. An inherited value is respected: the parent owns it, and
 * with several projects in one invocation only the first project's setup
 * creates the directory while the rest see it already present.
